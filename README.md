# TheBHClassifier

A repository of codes to classify the generation and formation channels of dynamically-formed gravitational-wave events using machine-learning algorithms.


This project is useful to all those who want to quickly inspect the main metrics of the dynamical interactions of an observed black-hole binary -- such as the generation and formation channel -- and it could also be useful as a benchmark analysis for further investigation of the hyperparameters of the globular clusters.

The analysis relies on [rapster](https://github.com/Kkritos/Rapster) simulations, and it assumes that these simulations represent fairly well the environs of globular clusters. The second main implicit assumption is that the binaries used in the event-based analysis are formed dynamically.

*The repo is under active development.*
